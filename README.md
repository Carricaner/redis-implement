# Redis Implementation Project

## Description


## Prerequisites

- Docker (docker & docker compose)
- bash (Unix-like system)


## Others
- For AWS Elastic Cache, we need to set up AWS Direct Connect & Transit Gateway because it cannot be connected publicly by default.
  - However, it is accessible for the EC2 instances under the same VPC.
